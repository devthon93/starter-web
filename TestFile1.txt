They identified the bogus Twitter accounts by using artificial intelligence 
to track where the tweets were coming from, the number of followers, 
and the frequency of tweets coming from a single account. 
Kathleen Carley, a computer-science professor who led the research, 
said the bots tweet more frequently than is humanly possible or tweet 
from different locations on opposite sides of the world just hours apart. 
(Thatâ€™s a little suspect when few people are jetting around the globe right now.)
